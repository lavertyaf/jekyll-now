Stock tracker using Ruby/HTML/CSS/Sinatra.

Stockify was build in week xxx of CodeClan. The brief was to build a webapp that would track stock within a record store.

Aileen really took the time to consider the user, and incorporated a stock ordering system, that could be used to connect a supplier to the record store directly.

The webapp was built in less than a week and used Ruby, HTML, CSS and Sinatra.

Aileen hand drew each of the iconic album covers to give the webapp a personal touch.

Future extensions would be to input a URL as the album image, allowing the stock of the store to be widened further.
