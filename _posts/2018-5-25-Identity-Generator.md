A name generator built using JavaScript/Node/API/PubSub Architecture

The name generator was built as a static site in order to demonstrate the use of API information as well as a PubSub architecture.

The webapp was created in three days at the end of week 12 of CodeClan and used JavaScript, Node, uinames.com api and PubSub.

The focus of the project was to have a little fun with the information available through the API. Further extensions would be to associate the gender chosen with an appropriate image, at the moment the image is chosen at random from an images file.
