title: Stock Trolley App
---

An app for selling stock on an airplane, built using Android & Java

This app was built during Java project week, this took place on week nine of CodeClan after three weeks of learning Java and one week of learning Android.

The app was a follow on from a out of hours project on building software for an airport, that was undertaken by Aileen and a fellow CodeClan student who wanted to further consolidate Java concepts.

Aileen planned to take a slice of this larger project and just focus on one area to build as her Android app. The app is designed to keep track of stock on an airline trolley, items can be selected and deselected, and a total is provided to the steward.

Future extensions would be to use data persistence, which would keep track of what is sold during the shift, and would give an end of shift record displaying stock sold, and total money made.
