An app to help students learn about the history of money, built in vanilla JavaScript/HTML/CSS

This app was a group project built during JavaScript project week, this took place on week 14 of CodeClan, and was built with Joseph Manuel, Ryan Mackay and Balazs Kertesz, all fellow CodeClan students.

The brief was to build an educational app, that featured some level of interactivity. The group decided on the history of money, displayed as an interactive timeline.

Together they constructed an API with 19 historical money related events, which were then displayed on a scrollable timeline. Each of the events is clickable, providing further information and a map of the location of the event, using Leaflet.js

A graph of the value of gold over time has also been featured to demonstrate how HighCharts.js can also be implemented.

The app is aimed at students, so the information is kept at a simplified level of language, using large graphics, and interactivity.

Future extensions would be to further use HighCharts.js to provide further visual data representation of the information.
